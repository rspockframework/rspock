# Best practices (d3mlabs snapshot)

We own this snapshot and evolve it as the org diverges. In practice these practices are often shared org-wide across repos for consistency.

## Priorities

- **Conventions over configuration**: Follow existing patterns and tooling before introducing new ones.
- **Clarity and maintainability**: Code should be easy to read and change; prefer explicit over clever.
- **Testability**: Design so that behavior can be tested with real inputs and minimal mocks.
- **Explicitness**: Prefer clear, named steps and obvious control flow over brevity that hides intent.

## Code and tests

- No TODOs, FIXMEs, or placeholders in committed code; finish or track elsewhere.
- In tests: use real files and temporary directories; avoid filesystem mocks.
- Minimal shared state between tests; avoid beforeAll/afterAll and global fixtures.
- Strict lint and existing code style; refactor until lint passes.
- Prefer existing helpers and patterns in the codebase; search before adding new abstractions.
